**file**: docs/requirements/requirement-shell-cli-zero-arguments.md  
**Status**: Active (Version 1.0.0)  
**Area**: shell  
**Key**: `requirement-shell-cli-zero-arguments`  
**Philosophy**: CIAO **v2.10.2** / CIAO-Lite (Caution • Intentional • Anti-fragile • Over-engineered / Over-protect)

## 1. Purpose

This requirement is the **project Single Source of Truth** for **zero-argument (empty argv) dispatcher behavior** of the take-ownership POSIX shell CLI.

### 1.0 Product type

| Field | Value for take-ownership |
|-------|-------------------------|
| **Empty-argv type** | **Type N — Non-online-install** |
| **Rationale** | Product is **local-only**; no `curl \| sh` channel; empty argv shows **help**, not install-ensure |

Type O (online-install empty-argv = install-ensure) does **not** apply.

---

## 2. Core Rules (Mandatory)

### 2.1 Single meaning of empty argv

1. When **argv is empty** (`$# -eq 0` at entry to `app_main`), the dispatcher **MUST** route to **`help`** / usage (`app_help`).  
2. Empty argv **MUST NOT** perform install, `action`, or any state-changing ensure.  
3. Explicit `take-ownership help` remains a valid full-usage path (same content family as empty argv).  
4. Explicit `take-ownership install` remains the only first-time local install path (plus documented force refresh).  
5. Script entry **MUST** always call `app_main "$@"` (no basename product-name gate that blocks dispatch).  
6. Empty argv **MUST NOT** become the numbered work list. That list is `take-ownership menu` (`requirement-shell-cli-default-interaction`).

### 2.2 Normative matrix

| Invocation | Behavior |
|------------|----------|
| `take-ownership` (no args) | Show help; exit 0 |
| `take-ownership help` | Show help; exit 0 |
| `take-ownership install` | Local install ensure |
| Flags only (e.g. `--json` with no command) | **MUST** still resolve to help (or fail with clear usage if product chooses fail-closed) — default: **help** after flag parse with no command token |

### 2.3 Implementation Notes (this project)

| Item | Value |
|------|--------|
| **Product** | `take-ownership` |
| **Type** | **Type N** |
| **Default COMMAND** | `help` |
| **Contrast parent** | cli-template is already Type N — **inherited**. (Historical: selfmanaged Type O was trimmed in 2026-08-03; not live origin.) |

### 2.4 Why This Requirement Exists (CIAO)

- **Principle 2 – Intentional**: Empty argv meaning is explicit and not left as “whatever the parent did.”  
- **Principle 1 – Caution**: Avoid surprise install on bare invocation for an ops CLI.  
- **Principle 16 – Interactive**: Help is the safe human default for local tools.

---

## 3. Design Principles (CIAO / CIAO-Lite)

- **Caution**: No silent ensure on empty argv.  
- **Intentional**: Type N declared in law.  
- **Anti-fragile**: Help works offline.  
- **Over-protect**: Do not reintroduce Type O without reclassifying product install mode.

---

## 4. Protection Rule (Sacred)

**Future AI assistants, Grok, or maintainers MUST NOT**:

1. Change empty argv to install-ensure while the product remains local-only.  
2. Copy a Type O empty-argv parent wholesale without updating this file and install mode.  
3. Make bare invocation run domain `action`.  
4. Attach the claimed numbered list to empty argv (that list is `take-ownership menu`).

**Violating this rule is a critical dispatcher regression.**

## 5. Acceptance criteria

| ID | Criterion |
|----|-----------|
| AC-1 | Empty argv shows help and does not install |
| AC-2 | Type N is the declared empty-argv type |
| AC-3 | `install` remains an explicit command |
